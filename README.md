# 🏓 Distributed Pong Embedded Control System

A distributed real-time electromechanical ping pong game developed for:

**TTK4155 – Embedded & Industrial Computer Systems Design (NTNU)**

This project demonstrates a fully distributed embedded control architecture using two interconnected microcontroller nodes communicating over CAN bus.

---

# 📌 System Overview

The system consists of two independent embedded nodes:

## 🧠 Node 1 – ATmega162 (Control & Interface Node)

Responsible for:
- User interface handling
- ADC joystick sampling
- OLED display communication (SPI)
- External SRAM interfacing (XMEM)
- CAN communication (MCP2515)
- Game logic management

### Key Hardware:
- ATmega162 development board
- External SRAM (16 kbit)
- OLED display (SPI)
- MCP2515 CAN controller
- CAN transceiver (MCP2551 / MAX258)
- Joystick module
- Breadboard with NAND logic ICs

---

## ⚙ Node 2 – ATSAM3X8E (Arduino Due) (Actuation Node)

Responsible for:
- PWM motor control
- Servo positioning
- PI control implementation
- Quadrature encoder feedback processing
- IR beam detection
- Relay and solenoid actuation
- CAN communication

### Key Hardware:
- Arduino Due (ATSAM3X8E)
- DC motor + quadrature encoder
- Servo motor
- Relay module
- Solenoid
- IR sensor
- CAN transceiver

---

# 🔌 Communication Architecture

The two nodes communicate via:

- MCP2515 CAN controller (SPI interface on Node 1)
- CAN bus (CAN_H / CAN_L differential signaling)
- Interrupt-driven CAN message handling

The system forms a distributed real-time control network.

---

# ⚡ Control Strategy

A PI controller is implemented on Node 2:

```
u(t) = Kp * e(t) + Ki * ∫ e(t) dt
```

Where:
- e(t) = position error
- Kp = proportional gain
- Ki = integral gain

Encoder feedback provides real-time motor position data.

PWM signals regulate motor speed and servo actuation.
